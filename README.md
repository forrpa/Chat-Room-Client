﻿#Chat-Room-Client

Chat Room client that works with my Chat-Room-Server.
Uses MySQL to store users.

You can chat with everyone that is online on the same port number and you can also send private messages. 
Before using you must register an account and/or log in. 

HOW TO USE
You can start program with default values ip 127.0.0.1 and port 2000.
To change ip address or both port and ip address you must open Client.jar in command prompt with -java jar Client.jar ipaddress portnumber

Examples:
-java jar Client.jar 127.0.0.10
or
-java jar Client.jar 127.0.0.10 3000

To use with my server, make sure both have the same port number.
